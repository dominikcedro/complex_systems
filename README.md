#### Lab 1 - Zipf's Law
Zipf's law is an empirical law stating that when a list 
of measured values is sorted in decreasing order,
the value of the nth entry is often approximately inversely proportional to n.

Goal of this lab is to analyze if ZIpf's law can be observed in english books (task1, task2)
and if the values correspond to theoritical Zipf's distribution (task2). Then 
based on Zipf-Mandelbrot law we aquire "a" and "b" parameters to determine
if languages can be described by them (task3). After that I analyzed if text
generated by LLM (like Chat GPT 4.0) provide similar values to literature.
